# Getting started

First you need to create a directory where you will store your templates anywhere that you want in your machine.

```bash
mkdir ~/.gogo/templates
```

Then you need you add it to `settings.yaml` see [set-template-path](#t-set-template-path) for info on how to easily do that

Finally you are ready to [create some templates](#creating-a-template).
**Templates need to be stored in a folder with the same name as the command they are meant for.**

For example if we have a command named `cpp` we need to store the templates for this command in `$TEMPLATE_FOLDER/cpp`.
