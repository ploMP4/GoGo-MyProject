# GoGo My Intro

GoGo is a cli tool that allows you to automatically create your project boilerplate

## Getting Started

Get started by **[Installing gogo](./category/installation/)**.

Make sure that gogo is installed by running the following:

```bash
gogo version
```

## Examples

After you [installed](./category/installation) gogo, you can copy
some example gadgets and templates from the [examples](https://github.com/ploMP4/GoGo-MyProject/tree/main/examples) folder in the repo. After that place the `gadgets` and `templates` folders inside your `.gogo` directory. Now you should see the example gadgets on the help menu and be able to use them.
